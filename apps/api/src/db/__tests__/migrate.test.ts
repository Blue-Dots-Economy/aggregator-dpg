/**
 * Unit tests for the migration runner (`runMigrations`).
 *
 * `drizzle-orm/node-postgres/migrator`'s `migrate()` is mocked and the shared
 * pool is replaced by a fake (per testing-requirements.md — no real DB/network
 * calls in unit tests) so these tests exercise the real folder-resolution,
 * advisory-lock ordering and error-propagation logic in `migrate.ts` without
 * touching a live database. The lock against a real Postgres is covered by
 * `contact-deploy.integration.test.ts`.
 *
 * The `isMain` CLI-entrypoint block (`if (isMain) { runMigrations()... }`) is
 * intentionally left uncovered: it only runs when this file is executed
 * directly as `node migrate.js` (`import.meta.url === file://${process.argv[1]}`),
 * which is never true under the Vitest runner (`process.argv[1]` is the
 * Vitest binary) — there is no way to exercise it as a unit test without
 * spawning a real child process, which would cross into integration-test
 * territory (real DB env vars) that this app deliberately keeps out of
 * `pnpm -w test`.
