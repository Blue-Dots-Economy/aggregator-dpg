/**
 * Isolated `safeAudit` coverage for its `err(BaseError)` branch (#617).
 *
 * `CampaignAuditWriterFake` (used by `submit-job.audit.test.ts`) only ever
 * THROWS on failure — by its own design, to exercise the "harsher" call-site
 * failure mode. But `PostgresCampaignAuditWriter` never throws: every one of
 * its methods catches the DB error internally and resolves
 * `err(UpstreamError)` (see `@aggregator-dpg/campaign-audit`'s `postgres.ts`).
 * That resolved-`err` path is the one a real deployment actually hits, so it
 * needs its own direct test rather than relying on the throwing fake to
 * stand in for it.
