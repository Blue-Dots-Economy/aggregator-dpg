# Pre-deploy runner for migration 0025 (`contact` table) on an EXISTING instance.
#
# SUPERSEDED for the user & org release train: deployed instances (all at
# 0022) migrate with scripts/user-org-migrate.sh, which covers 0023 onwards in
# one window. This script and scripts/sql/contact-*.sql only understand the
# schema BEFORE migration 0027 (`aggregators`, `aggregator_orgs.contact_id`);
# they are kept for databases still on that path and removed with the train.
#
# Phase 1 ships as one release, deployed stop-the-world. The migration file IS
# the script: `apply` runs apps/api/drizzle/migrations/0025_contact.sql with
# psql; the release's first API boot re-runs it through drizzle (a no-op) and
# then applies 0026, which drops the legacy columns. A fresh instance does not
# need this script; its first boot creates everything.
#
# Run it from a checkout of the RELEASE TAG you are about to deploy, so the SQL
# you pre-apply is byte-identical to what the pods will run.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/contact-migrate.sh preflight   # read-only report; exit 1 if any blocking count > 0
#   ./scripts/contact-migrate.sh dry-run     # apply + verify inside a transaction, then ROLLBACK;
#                                            # exit non-zero if 0025 or the verify gate fails
#   ./scripts/contact-migrate.sh apply       # apply for real (single transaction)
#   ./scripts/contact-migrate.sh verify      # read-only V1–V6 report; exit 1 if V1 or V2 > 0,
#                                            # or V4 > 0 while the legacy columns exist
#
# Runbook (docs/contact-migration-runbook.md):
#   preflight + dry-run (may run while live) → scale api + worker to 0 →
#   DB snapshot → apply → verify → deploy the API at 1 replica (its boot
#   applies 0026) → verify → start the worker, scale up → owner-name backfill.
#
# Postgres — pick ONE (read from the environment or the project .env):
#   DATABASE_URL   postgres://user:pass@host:port/db   (uses local psql)
#   PG_CONTAINER   docker container name              (uses `docker exec psql`)
#                  with PG_USER / PG_DB (default POSTGRES_USER / POSTGRES_DB)
#   PSQL_CMD       full command prefix, e.g. "kubectl exec -i pod/psql -- psql -U app -d aggregator"
#
# Run it as the application role that owns the tables, or as a role that may
# SET ROLE to it (e.g. a superuser): 0025 switches to the table owner itself so
# everything it creates stays writable by the app, and refuses any other role.
# Needs PostgreSQL 14+ (CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER).
#
# Needs bash + psql (or docker / kubectl) and python3 (only to read .env).
# PSQL_CMD is word-split, so it cannot carry quoted arguments with spaces.
#
# The script never writes drizzle's __drizzle_migrations table; the API boot
# records 0025 there when it re-runs the (now no-op) file.
