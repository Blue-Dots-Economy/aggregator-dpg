-- contact-preflight.sql — READ-ONLY pre-flight for migration 0025 (`contact`).
--
-- Run BEFORE `scripts/contact-migrate.sh apply` on an existing instance.
-- Every "blocking" count must be 0; otherwise 0025 refuses to create the table
-- (its first-creation guard re-runs the same checks) and
-- `scripts/contact-migrate.sh preflight` exits 1. Fix the listed rows by
-- hand, coordinating with Keycloak (it holds the same identity), then re-run.
-- Safe to run against the live database: it only reads the application
-- tables (the one object it creates is a session-local TEMP VIEW).
--
-- Output is row ids and counts only — never an email, phone or name — so it
-- is safe to paste into a ticket.

-- One row per person-bearing row (coordinator or org owner), with the email and
-- phone extracted once. A session-local TEMP VIEW, so both reports below read
-- the same definition; it touches no application table and is dropped at the
-- end (and with the session regardless).
