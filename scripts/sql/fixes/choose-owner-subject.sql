-- fix choose-owner-subject (F15) — at the 0022 shape, one owner (same email +
-- phone) whose orgs record different Keycloak subjects: keep the subject of
-- the given org (normally the live one) on every org of that owner.
-- Parameter: `train_fix.org_id` (set by `train fix`) — the `aggregator_orgs.id` whose subject wins.
-- Prints counts only.
