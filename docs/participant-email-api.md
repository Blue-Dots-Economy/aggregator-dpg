# Participant Email API (campaign-manager)

**Ticket:** aggregator-dpg#578 · **Umbrella:** Blue-Dots-Economy/signals-dpg#237
**Status:** Implemented on the campaign async-job engine (#579) · **Branch:** `feat/578-participant-email`

Design of record: the two campaign specs on `spec/campaign-async-job-model` —
[API contract normalization](superpowers/specs/2026-08-12-campaign-api-contract-normalization-design.md)
and [async batch processing](superpowers/specs/2026-08-12-campaign-async-batch-processing-design.md).
This document is the email channel's slice of them.

---

## 1. What this is

The campaign-manager application needs to **email participants that its
organisation owns** (e.g. follow-ups). The campaign author composes one message —
a **subject** and a **Markdown body**, optionally with a few **placeholders**
(`{{name}}`, …) — and sends the aggregator a list of **participant references**
(profile item ids). The campaign-manager never sends, and never sees, any email
address.

The aggregator resolves each participant's email **on the server** (from the
encrypted participant store), personalises the message per recipient, and sends
it. The request is **asynchronous**: the API validates it, persists a durable
**campaign job** and returns a `job_id`; a background worker performs the
decrypt + render + send and writes a per-recipient outcome back onto the job,
which the caller polls.

**Personal data never leaves the aggregator.** The caller sends only item ids;
the resolved email addresses (and any other personal fields) are used solely to
build and send the emails, and are never returned to the caller or written to any
caller-visible surface — the poll endpoint reports item ids and statuses only.

---

## 2. Scope

- **Three endpoints:** submit (`POST /v1/campaign/email`), job status
  (`GET /v1/campaign/email/{job_id}`) and job list (`GET /v1/campaign/email`).
- **One shared message**, sent to N owned participants.
- **Optional placeholders** — if the subject/body contains a supported placeholder
  it is replaced with that participant's value; if there are none, the same
  message is sent to everyone. Placeholders are **not** required.
- **Markdown body** → rendered to HTML + a plain-text fallback, sanitised.
- **Per-recipient outcomes are reported**: every item id carries a terminal status
  (`sent` / `skipped_no_contact` / `skipped_not_owned` / `failed`) plus, for a
  successful send, the mailer's message id as `provider_ref`.

**Not in scope here:**

- Email-contact **consent** gating.
- **Profile-field** placeholders beyond the fixed identity set in §5 (see §5.1).
- Attachments; scheduled/delayed send.
- **notification-service delivery.** #578's text says "via notification-service";
  the send goes through the aggregator's own mailer (`@aggregator-dpg/mailer`,
  the same transport as approval/support mail) instead. Accepted deviation,
  recorded on the issue — routing campaign mail through notification-service can
  swap in behind this same job without an API change.

---

## 3. Authentication & authorization

**Token.** Every request carries `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — a Keycloak
access token issued to the campaign-manager application when a campaign-manager
user logs in (interactive OIDC login; the client holds no secret). The token
identifies both the **user** and, via custom claims, the **organisation** they act
for.

**Client scoping (who may call this API).** The endpoint accepts a token **only
if** the token's `azp` claim (the Keycloak client that requested it) is in the
allow-list `CAMPAIGN_MANAGER_ALLOWED_AZP` (default: `campaign-manager`). Tokens
from any other client are rejected with `401`. This client is intentionally kept
out of the aggregator's general token allow-list, so a campaign-manager token is
**only** usable on the campaign endpoints and nowhere else in the aggregator.

**Organisation identity.** The acting organisation is read from the token's
`signalstack_org_id` claim — it is **never** taken from a request header or body.
A token without that claim is rejected with `403`.

**Ownership (which participants a caller may email).** Ownership is enforced by
the participant store: the decrypt call is scoped to the caller's organisation, so
it returns data **only** for participants that organisation onboarded. Any
requested `item_id` the organisation does not own is recorded
`skipped_not_owned` and never emailed. A caller cannot email participants
belonging to another organisation, even by guessing ids — and the skip reveals
nothing about whether the id exists elsewhere.

---

## 4. API

### `POST /v1/campaign/email`

Validates the request, persists a campaign job (one row per recipient) and
**queues** it. Returns `202` with the `job_id` once the job is durably stored and
enqueued. No personal data is present in the request or the response.

**Headers:** `Idempotency-Key` (optional — a replay returns the same `job_id` and
sends once), `x-request-id` (optional — propagated to the decrypt call as the
correlation id).

**Request body** (`application/json`) — the shared campaign envelope. The
top-level envelope and the `content` block are both **strict** (unknown keys
rejected); `metadata` is an open key/value list by design.

| Field                   | Type                               | Required | Notes                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `item_ids`              | `string[]` (UUID)                  | yes      | The participants to email. 1 … `CAMPAIGN_EMAIL_MAX_ITEMS` (default 200) after de-dup. Over the cap → `400`, never truncated.   |
| `metadata`              | `{ key: string, value: string }[]` | no       | Free-form cross-cutting inputs (e.g. `purpose`, `consent`), stored verbatim on the job. Unknown keys are accepted and ignored. |
| `content.subject`       | `string`                           | yes      | ≤ 200 chars. Plain text. May contain placeholders (§5).                                                                        |
| `content.body_markdown` | `string`                           | yes      | ≤ 20 000 chars. Markdown. May contain placeholders (§5). Rendered on the server.                                               |
| `content.reply_to`      | `string` (email)                   | no       | Sets the email `Reply-To`. The `From` address is always the aggregator's configured sender.                                    |

**Example request**

```jsonc
POST /v1/campaign/email
Authorization: Bearer <campaign-manager access token>
Idempotency-Key: 2026-08-25-q3-followup-1
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "item_ids": [
    "e4e163e7-c4ad-42f9-9550-af6f09267e14",
    "13ccd407-9965-44ff-9d04-2a1561c4f740"
  ],
  "metadata": [{ "key": "purpose", "value": "Q3 follow-up" }],
  "content": {
    "subject": "Hi {{first_name}}, an update on your application",
    "body_markdown": "Hi {{name}},\n\nWe have an **update** for you:\n\n- Step one is complete\n- Step two starts next week\n\nThanks!",
    "reply_to": "campaign@org.example"
  }
}
```

**Success — `202 Accepted`**

```json
{
  "status": "queued",
  "requested": 2,
  "job_id": "9f1c8a52-3d77-4a1e-b0a6-6b3f0e2a91c4",
  "message": "Your campaign email has been queued. Poll GET /v1/campaign/email/{job_id} for per-recipient outcomes."
}
```

> `202` means the job is **durably queued** — not that the emails have been sent.
> Decrypt + send happen asynchronously in the worker; poll for outcomes.

**Error responses**

| HTTP  | `error.code`              | When                                                                                                                                     |
| ----- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `400` | `SCHEMA_VALIDATION`       | Malformed body: non-UUID / empty `item_ids`, missing `content.subject`/`content.body_markdown`, over-long fields, or unknown keys.       |
| `400` | `UNKNOWN_PLACEHOLDER`     | The subject or body contains a `{{token}}` outside the supported set (§5). Fail-closed, so a typo never ships to real inboxes.           |
| `400` | `CAMPAIGN_TOO_MANY_ITEMS` | `item_ids` (after de-dup) exceeded `CAMPAIGN_EMAIL_MAX_ITEMS`. `error.fields` reports `max` and `received`.                              |
| `401` | `UNAUTHORIZED`            | Token missing / malformed / bad signature or expiry, **or** the token's `azp` is not an allowed campaign-manager client.                 |
| `403` | `FORBIDDEN`               | Token is valid but lacks the organisation claim (`MISSING_SIGNALSTACK_ORG`) or the aggregator claim (`MISSING_AGGREGATOR_ID`).           |
| `429` | `CAMPAIGN_RATE_LIMITED`   | Ingress rate-limit for this org tripped (§8). `Retry-After` is set.                                                                      |
| `429` | `CAMPAIGN_ACTIVE_LIMIT`   | The org already has `CAMPAIGN_EMAIL_MAX_ACTIVE_PER_ORG` email jobs in flight. Counted per channel — an export job never blocks an email. |
| `503` | `EMAIL_ENQUEUE_FAILED`    | The job row was written but could not be queued (e.g. Redis unreachable). A `202` must mean durably queued, so this is surfaced.         |

### `GET /v1/campaign/email/{job_id}`

The job's status, derived counts and per-item outcomes. Scoped to the caller's
org **and** to the email channel — another org's job, or a job on another channel,
returns `403` (never a `404` that would confirm the id exists).

```json
{
  "job_id": "9f1c8a52-3d77-4a1e-b0a6-6b3f0e2a91c4",
  "channel": "email",
  "status": "completed",
  "counts": { "total": 2, "pending": 0, "sent": 1, "skipped_no_contact": 1, "failed": 0, "...": 0 },
  "metadata": [{ "key": "purpose", "value": "Q3 follow-up" }],
  "items": [
    {
      "item_id": "e4e163e7-c4ad-42f9-9550-af6f09267e14",
      "status": "sent",
      "provider_ref": "<smtp-message-id>",
      "skip_reason": null,
      "error_reason": null
    },
    {
      "item_id": "13ccd407-9965-44ff-9d04-2a1561c4f740",
      "status": "skipped_no_contact",
      "provider_ref": null,
      "skip_reason": "no_email_address",
      "error_reason": null
    }
  ],
  "created_at": "2026-08-25T09:12:04.001Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-08-25T09:12:07.884Z"
}
```

**Per-item statuses**

| Status               | Meaning                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pending`            | Not yet acted on (job still queued/processing).                              |
| `sent`               | The mailer accepted the message; `provider_ref` holds its message id.        |
| `skipped_no_contact` | The participant has no email address on file. Not a failure.                 |
| `skipped_not_owned`  | The caller's org does not own this item. Not a failure.                      |
| `failed`             | The send was attempted and the mailer rejected it (`error_reason` says why). |

**Job status** is derived from those counts, never stored as a counter:
`processing` while any item is pending, then `completed` (no failures — skips are
deliberate no-ops, so an all-skipped job still completes), `partial` (a mix) or
`failed` (no successes).

### `GET /v1/campaign/email`

The org's email jobs, newest first, with the same derived counts. Cursor
paginated (`limit`, `cursor` → `next_cursor`). Email jobs only.

## 5. Placeholders (fixed set, optional)

Placeholders let the campaign author personalise the message. They are
**optional**: if the subject/body contains one it is replaced per recipient; if it
contains none, the identical message is sent to everyone.

**Supported placeholders** — all resolved from the participant's stored contact
identity:

| Placeholder      | Value                                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `{{name}}`       | The participant's full name.                    |
| `{{first_name}}` | The first word of the name (for greetings).     |
| `{{last_name}}`  | The remainder of the name after the first word. |
| `{{email}}`      | The participant's own email address.            |
| `{{phone}}`      | The participant's phone number.                 |

**Rules**

- **Syntax:** `{{token}}` (double curly braces). Inner whitespace is tolerated
  and the token is matched case-insensitively, so `{{ name }}`, `{{Name}}` and
  `{{LAST_NAME}}` all resolve normally — a capitalisation slip is not an error.
- **Unknown token → `400 UNKNOWN_PLACEHOLDER`** at submit time (before the job is
  created), naming the offending token — e.g. `{{city}}` or `{{programme}}`.
  `{{ … }}` is therefore reserved syntax in the subject and body.
- **Missing value:** if a supported placeholder has no value for a participant
  (e.g. no name on file), it renders as an **empty string** — the email is still
  sent. Only a missing **email address** skips that recipient
  (`skipped_no_contact`).
- **Minimal data access:** the server only decrypts the fields the message
  actually uses. The recipient email is always needed; `name`/`phone` are decrypted
  only if the corresponding placeholder appears.

**Rendering & safety**

1. The Markdown body is rendered to HTML **once** (the template is shared).
2. The HTML is **sanitised** (scripts, event handlers, and unsafe URLs stripped).
3. For each recipient, each `{{token}}` is replaced with the participant's value —
   **HTML-escaped** in the HTML part (so a value can never inject markup) and used
   verbatim in the plain-text part.

The message structure is author-controlled; the substituted personal values are
always escaped, so decrypted data cannot alter the message structure.

### 5.1 Extra (profile) placeholders — needs input

Anything beyond the identity fields above (e.g. `{{location}}`, `{{program}}` /
applied role, `{{reference_id}}`, `{{status}}`, a date) lives in the participant's
**profile**, and those field names **differ between participant types / networks**.
To avoid exposing arbitrary personal data, these are **not** supported by a generic
mechanism. Instead:

> **Campaign team, please tell us the exact extra fields your emails need.** We
> will add each as a **named, curated placeholder** mapped to the correct profile
> field per participant type (a small config change), rather than allowing free
> access to any field. If the emails only need greetings, the identity set above
> is sufficient.

---

## 6. Body format (Markdown)

- The body is submitted as **Markdown** (`content.body_markdown`). The server
  produces the two parts an email needs:
  - **HTML part** = sanitised HTML rendered from the Markdown, with placeholders
    substituted.
  - **Plain-text part** = the Markdown source with placeholders substituted (it is
    already human-readable).
- Basic formatting — **bold**, paragraphs / blank-line spacing, bulleted lists,
  and links — renders correctly in email clients from the generated HTML.
- Rendering + sanitising live in `packages/campaign-template` (a Markdown renderer
  plus an HTML sanitiser), isolated from the route and the worker.

---

## 7. How it works, end to end

**Phase 1 — API (synchronous, returns `202`):**

1. Authenticate the token and enforce the campaign-manager client gate (§3).
2. Read the acting organisation from the token's `signalstack_org_id` claim
   (`403` if absent).
3. Validate the envelope + `content`, de-dup `item_ids` and enforce the per-request
   cap; validate every placeholder against the supported set
   (`400 UNKNOWN_PLACEHOLDER` on an unknown token).
4. Apply the ingress rate-limit and the per-org active-job cap (§8).
5. In **one transaction**, insert the `campaign_job` row (channel `email`, the
   `content` block and `metadata` stored verbatim) plus one `campaign_job_item`
   row per recipient, honouring `Idempotency-Key`.
6. Enqueue one `campaign-process` job carrying only the `job_id`, and return
   **`202 { status, requested, job_id, message }`**. The API never decrypts or
   sends.

**Phase 2 — Worker (asynchronous, the `campaign` role):**

7. Load the job; skip it if it is already terminal, else mark it `processing`.
8. Select the items that are **not** already terminal, and **decrypt** them
   **scoped to the acting organisation** so only owned participants resolve
   (unowned ids → `skipped_not_owned`). Only the contact fields the message uses
   are requested, in `CAMPAIGN_DECRYPT_CHUNK`-sized chunks with a heartbeat per
   chunk.
9. **Render** the Markdown → sanitised HTML once.
10. **Per recipient:** resolve the email (none → `skipped_no_contact`); substitute
    placeholders; send via the aggregator's mailer (SES/SMTP) with
    `EMAIL_SEND_CONCURRENCY` in flight; write the item's terminal status —
    `sent` (+ the mailer message id as `provider_ref`) or `failed` (+ reason). A
    per-recipient failure never aborts the rest of the batch.
11. Roll the job status up from the item counts. Structured logs carry counts and
    item ids only — **no personal data is logged**.

### Retries and duplicate sends

The job retries like every other campaign job (`CAMPAIGN_EMAIL_ATTEMPTS`,
default 3, exponential backoff) — it is **not** `attempts: 1`. Duplicate sends
are prevented by the **per-item terminal-status guard** instead: an item already
`sent` (or skipped/failed) is terminal, so a retried job neither decrypts nor
re-emails it, and the item write is forward-only in the store. That gives
durability against a transient decrypt/Redis/mailer blip **and** no duplicate
emails, rather than trading one for the other.

Two failure modes are deliberately distinguished:

- **Transient / infra** (decrypt error, the Signals #521 contact-block guard) —
  re-thrown, so BullMQ retries and the job stays `processing`.
- **Deterministic** (the stored `content` fails re-validation) — every still-
  actionable item is marked `failed` and the job rolls up to `failed`, because a
  retry could not fix it.

---

## 8. Configuration

Per channel by design — the email knobs are never shared with export or voice.

| Setting                                | Default            | Purpose                                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CAMPAIGN_EMAIL_MAX_ITEMS`             | `200`              | Maximum `item_ids` per request (after de-dup); exceeding it → `400`. |
| `CAMPAIGN_EMAIL_SUBMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS` | `60`               | Ingress rate-limit window per org.                                   |
| `CAMPAIGN_EMAIL_SUBMIT_MAX`            | `10`               | Max submits per window per org.                                      |
| `CAMPAIGN_EMAIL_MAX_ACTIVE_PER_ORG`    | `3`                | Max in-flight (`queued`/`processing`) email jobs per org.            |
| `CAMPAIGN_EMAIL_ATTEMPTS`              | `3`                | BullMQ attempts per email job (safe — see the retry note in §7).     |
| `EMAIL_SEND_CONCURRENCY`               | `5`                | Emails sent in parallel within one job (worker).                     |
| `CAMPAIGN_MANAGER_ALLOWED_AZP`         | `campaign-manager` | The Keycloak client(s) permitted on the campaign endpoints.          |

Shared with the rest of the engine: `CAMPAIGN_DECRYPT_CHUNK`,
`CAMPAIGN_STALL_SECONDS`, `CAMPAIGN_CONCURRENCY` (parallel campaign jobs per
worker process — all channels), plus the mail transport
(`MAIL_PROVIDER` + `SMTP_*` / `SES_*`) and `REDIS_URL`.

---

## 9. Acceptance

- Emails are sent only to participants the caller's organisation owns; ids it does
  not own are reported `skipped_not_owned`.
- A participant with no email address is `skipped_no_contact` without failing the
  batch, and a skip never makes the job `partial`.
- Per-recipient outcomes are reported to the caller via the poll endpoint,
  including the mailer's message id for a successful send.
- A retried job never re-emails a recipient already `sent`.
- The message is rendered on the server; the campaign-manager never receives any
  email address or other personal data.
- A campaign-manager token cannot reach any other aggregator endpoint, and no
  other client can reach this one.
