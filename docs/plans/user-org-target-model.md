# User & Org management refactor: target model and phase map

**Date:** 2026-10-05 (reworked after the decisions of the same day)
**Status:** Plan. Every cross-phase decision is answered (§1). The per-phase designs are `users-phase-2.md`, `organisation-phase-3.md` and `cleanup-phase-4.md`; the path for existing instances is `existing-instance-migration.md`.

**Direction (2026-10-05):**

1. `aggregators` becomes **`users`**, with the complete details of the user.
2. `aggregator_orgs` becomes **`organisations`**, with the complete details of the org.
3. `org_type` is `aggregator` or `network_facilitator`, with **exactly one** `network_facilitator`.
4. Every organisation has an **`org_owner`** (a `users.id`).
5. Organisation details move from the coordinator row to `organisations`: **`url`, `locations`, company, GST number**. Responses render them **from the user's linked org**.
6. Duplicate data is removed (consent, …).
7. Existing instances must migrate easily.

**Why the coordinator keeps `signalstack_org_slug` / `signalstack_org_name`.** They are the identity of the coordinator's **Signals organisation** (`external_id` = user id, `slug`, `name`), and `signalstack_org_slug` is the `[org]` segment of every public registration-link URL. Moving them would rename Signals orgs and break published links. The **organisation's** own `slug` and `name` are separate: today they are the parent org's.

**Future: one user in several orgs.** Today an account belongs to at most one org (`users.org_id` for coordinators; `org_owner` for admins). When a user may belong to several orgs, `users.org_id` becomes a membership table (`user_orgs (user_id, org_id, role, status)`), and the coordinator's per-org tenant columns move onto that membership row. The schema keeps this additive:

- identities hang off `users.id`, not off an org or a contact;
- tenant data already carries both `user_id` and `org_id`;
- nothing else keys on `users.org_id`.

**Identity provider independence.** The app talks to the IAM only through the `IdpAdminAdapter` port (`services/idp-admin/interface.ts`), and the database stores only `provider + subject`. The Keycloak attribute `aggregator_id` (= `users.id`) is the provider-side link; another provider needs an equivalent claim, or a lookup by `user_identities`.

**Naming rule (review A23; option C chosen 2026-10-07).**

- `org_id` always means `organisations.id`.
- **A coordinator's own Signals organisation**, the separate space in Signals that holds that coordinator's participants, uploads, links and campaigns (called the "Signals tenant" elsewhere in these docs), is always described by `signalstack_org_*` columns on the coordinator's `users` row:
  - `signalstack_org_id`: the id Signals returns;
  - `signalstack_org_slug`: was `org_slug`; the Signals slug, and the `[org]` segment of public registration-link URLs;
  - `signalstack_org_name`: was `name`; NULL means "use the linked org's name".
- `onboarding.org_slug` is renamed `signalstack_org_slug` too.
- These are **not** the coordinator's organisation (`organisations.slug` / `name`), and **not** the person (`contact.name`).
- `user_type` / `org_type` are the only type columns.
- API response fields (`org_slug`, `org_name`) are unchanged.

- A coordinator's org is `users.org_id`; an admin's orgs are `organisations.org_owner`. There is no FK cycle, so inserts need no deferred constraints.
- **Registration state** lives on the coordinator user and on the org, each for its own registration. An admin account has none; it can log in when its Keycloak user is enabled.
- **The tenant name** is stored only when it differs from the org's name. Signals and `org_name` read `coalesce(signalstack_org_name, org.name)`.
- **The invite** is referenced (`invite_id`), not copied.
- **Login identities are provider-neutral and belong to the account:** `user_identities (user_id, provider, subject)`. They are **not** on `contact` (a person's data) and have **no** Keycloak-specific column, so another IAM provider is a new `provider` value, and an account can hold more than one login.

## 3. Where every current column goes

### 3.1 `aggregators` → `users` (Phase 2 renames; later phases move columns)

| Column                                                                 | Goes to                                                                                                                                                                                        | Phase |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| `id`, `contact_id`, `status`, `rejected_at`, audit columns             | stay (`users`); `status` uses the renamed enum `registration_status`                                                                                                                           | 2 / 4 |

| `contact_gc()` and the delete triggers | rewritten to check `users` only (the function names tables in its body, so it would break on rename) | 2     |

## 4. Moving the org details, and rendering them

### 4.1 Adoption rule (per organisation, in the Phase 3 migration)

For each of `url`, `locations`, `legal_name`, `gst_number`:

1. **The org's own value** wins when it has one (parent orgs: `profile.website`, `profile.address` + `state`).
2. **Otherwise, adopt the coordinators' value** when every linked coordinator that has one agrees (exactly one distinct non-empty value).
3. **Otherwise leave it empty.** This is always the case for the Default org: it is a bucket of unrelated flat coordinators, so their values never become its value.

### 4.2 Nothing is lost: `legacy_org_details`

There is no archive (G18), so a coordinator value that was **not** adopted is kept on the coordinator's own row: `users.legacy_org_details = {url, locations, company, gstNumber}`. Only the fields that differ from the org's are kept. The pre-flight reports the counts per org (F13).

### 4.3 Rendering (profile GET, approval emails, anything that shows a coordinator)

| Field                                                      | Rendered from                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`, `locations`, `contact.company`, `contact.gstNumber` | **The linked org** (`users.org_id`). **When the org's field is empty**, fall back to the coordinator's `legacy_org_details`, so a flat coordinator in the Default org still sees what it registered until real org data exists. |
| `org_name`, `org_slug`                                     | `coalesce(users.signalstack_org_name, org.name)` / `users.signalstack_org_slug`: the Signals tenant identity, byte-identical for every existing row.                                                                            |
| `contact.name`, `email`, `phone`, `alternatePhone`         | `contact` + `users.alternate_phone`.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

**Visible effect:** a coordinator whose own value differed from an org value that exists now sees the **org's** value. That is the intended change (direction 5). The fallback keeps everyone else byte-identical.

### 4.4 Writes

- **Profile PATCH** of `url`, `locations` or company / GST by a coordinator would change data **shared by every coordinator of the org**, so it is **refused** with a new `409 ORG_DETAILS_READ_ONLY`. The web never sends a profile PATCH, so there is no UI change. The org's details are edited by its owner through the Phase 5 org APIs.
- **Coordinator registration** no longer collects these fields. They are removed from the coordinator `registration.v1.json` schemas (base and brands). If an old client still sends them, the API **accepts and ignores** them for one release (logged at `warn`), then rejects them.
- **Org registration** maps the form's `website`, `address` + `state` to `url` / `locations`, and gains optional company / GST fields per brand schema.

## 5. Phase map

All phases land on `feature` as separate PRs and ship in **one release train** (G15). Every existing instance goes from migration 0022 to the end in one window (`existing-instance-migration.md`).

**Why this order.** `organisations.org_owner` and the NF admin need `users` rows, so users come first. Org details can move only once `users.org_id` exists. Cleanup comes last because it depends on both.

**Branch consequence.** The `app_user` commits (old Phase 2, 0027/0028) are removed from `refactor/user-org-management`; `backup/user-org-pre-rebase` keeps them. Reusable parts are ported into the new Phase 2: login-identity recording (`recordKcSubject` → `recordIdentity`, writing `user_identities`), the verify-script pattern, the owner-subject reads and writes, and the tests. **The migration numbers 0027–0029 are reused**, which is safe because no shared environment ever applied the old 0027/0028 (G20). Local dev databases that did must be recreated, or have those two rows deleted from `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` along with the `app_user` objects (`existing-instance-migration.md` §8).

## 7. Review of 2026-10-06

`plan-review-2026-10-06.md` records:

- the corner cases (K1–K12);
- the simplifications applied here (M1–M7);
- the reads and writes per operation;
- the **revert** design (V1–V3): `user-org-migrate.sh revert` takes an instance back to the 0022 schema **keeping post-go-live writes**, and a CI round-trip test proves it (`existing-instance-migration.md` §13).

| R1  | Show the Default org in the registration dropdown, or only use it for migrated data?   | **Show it**: a fresh or formerly-flat instance otherwise has no org to pick until one is registered and approved. |
| R2  | How long old clients may send org details on coordinator registration before rejection | **One release.**                                                                                                  |
| R3  | Should the org's details also appear in the org approval email?                        | **Yes**, once they are columns (Phase 3), at no extra cost.                                                       |
