# Init-container image that ships the Keycloak `otp` theme plus per-
# network brand values baked into `theme.properties` and `template.ftl`.
#
# Pattern: at pod start, this image runs as an initContainer, copies
# `/custom` into a shared emptyDir, then exits. The main Keycloak
# container mounts the same emptyDir at `/opt/keycloak/themes`, so the
# Keycloak image stays vanilla while every per-deployment string is
# frozen into the theme image hash.
#
# Build (one image per network):
#   docker build -f infra/keycloak/themes.Dockerfile \
#     --build-arg NETWORK=purple_dot \
#     --build-arg BRAND_SHORT_NAME='Purple Dots' \
#     --build-arg BRAND_LONG_NAME='Purple Dot Aggregator Portal' \
#     --build-arg BRAND_PRIMARY_COLOR='#A855F7' \
#     --build-arg BRAND_PRIMARY_DARK='#7C3AED' \
#     --build-arg BRAND_PRIMARY_500='#A855F7' \
#     --build-arg BRAND_PRIMARY_100='#EDE9FE' \
#     --build-arg BRAND_PRIMARY_50='#F5F3FF' \
#     --build-arg BRAND_HERO_BG='#1E1B4B' \
#     --build-arg BRAND_HERO_GRAD='#C4B5FD' \
#     --build-arg HERO_TITLE_LEAD='Welcome to' \
#     --build-arg HERO_TITLE_HIGHLIGHT='Purple Dots' \
#     --build-arg HERO_TITLE_TAIL='discovery & services for people with disabilities.' \
#     --build-arg HERO_SUBTITLE='Sign in to manage beneficiaries, service providers, and onboarding across the network.' \
#     --build-arg EMAIL_SIGNOFF='Team ALIMCO' \
#     -t registry.your.co/aggregator-kc-theme:purple-v1 .
#
# Or simpler — pass `--build-arg-file config/<network>/keycloak.env`.

# Docker Hardened Image. Same busybox 1.38, but it runs as `nonroot` (uid 65532)

# Sign-off on the login-OTP email (#626). The email theme's copy is otherwise

# Init-container entrypoint: copy the themes into the shared volume the main
# Keycloak container mounts at /opt/keycloak/themes, then exit. Using
# `cp -aT` so symlinks (e.g. ../themes/...) and timestamps survive.
#
# Stages the WHOLE tree, not just `otp`: `signals` (which the signals-ui client
# selects via its `login_theme` attribute) sits alongside it, and copying only
# `otp` would leave that override pointing at a theme absent from disk. Both are
# listed so a missing one fails the init container loudly instead of silently
# falling back to the realm default.
#
# TWO THINGS THIS DEPENDS ON, now that the image runs as nonroot (uid 65532):
#
#  1. The Keycloak pod's `fsGroup` MUST be set. The kubelet then group-owns the
#     shared emptyDir and adds that group to this process, which is the only
#     reason uid 65532 can write into it. Verified against the current
#     `fsGroup: 0`: exits 0, stages 42 files. Without an fsGroup the volume is
#     root-owned 0755 and this fails with `cp: can't create directory
#     '/shared/otp': Permission denied` and exit 1 — i.e. Keycloak never starts.
#
#  2. `cp -aT` emits three harmless warnings on every boot:
#       cp: can't preserve times/ownership/permissions of '/shared'
#     A nonroot user cannot chown the destination directory. They are NOT
#     failures — cp continues and exits 0. `-a` is kept deliberately (see above:
#     symlinks must survive); `-rT` would dereference them.
